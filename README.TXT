BfMeshView
==========

Battlefield Mesh Viewer (BfMeshView) is a model viewer for "Battlefield 1942",
"Battlefield 2", "Battlefield Heroes" and "Battlefield Play 4 Free". Although
it originated as a model viewer, it actually has some useful editing tools.

BfMeshView was created and extensively used during development of the BF2 mod
"Forgotten Hope 2".
