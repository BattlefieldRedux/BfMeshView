BFMESHVIEW

Battlefield Mesh Viewer (BfMeshView) is a model viewer for "Battlefield 1942",
"Battlefield 2", "Battlefield 2142, "Battlefield Heroes" and "Battlefield Play 4
Free". Although it originated as a model viewer, it now actually has some useful
editing tools.

BfMeshView was created and extensively used during development of the BF2 mod
"Forgotten Hope 2" (http://www.fhmod.org).

SOURCE CODE

BfMeshView is written in Visual Basic 6.0, with a C++ DLL module that handles
some things that VB6 does not support. These are mostly OpenGL extension related
functions. A OpenGL type library, which provides VB6 language binding is
included, of which source code is available.
